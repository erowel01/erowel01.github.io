      <h1>Making a Webpage Go Live with Git!</h1>

      <h2>The Tools</h2>

      <p>
          In order to perform this incredible task, first you must have the correct tools. These tools include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          A Github account
        </li>
        <li>
          Github for Desktop
        </li>
        <li>
          Atom
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        With these tools, you can change the world!
      </p>

      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Firstly, sign into your Github account on your browser. This is imperative to the rest of the process. Ensure that you have
          verified your email for maximum efficiency.
        </li>
        <li>
          Secondly, create a brand spankin' new repository for your website on Github. Optionally, include a README file.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, you'll need to sign into Github for desktop with the same account. This will allow you to link the online Github server
          with your local desktop.
        </li>
        <li>
          Afer that, you must clone that repository from Step 2. Do not add or create in this situation, which would surely lead to only
          disaster. Save it to a convenient and logical place for your purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now, switch to Atom, and create yourself an "index.html" file. Or perhaps you already have one. In either case, it should be saved
          into the cloned repository, located in the "git" folder, wherever you happened to save that.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once this has been done, you'll want to switch back to Github for Desktop. If everything has gone according to plan, then under
          the "Changes" tab, you should have an astonishing "1" icon. This will show you your new file. After a quick double check to make
          sure everything is in order, give your change a name, and press the "commit to master" button.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, smash that "sync" button on the top right and wait for it to do its thing.
        </li>
        <li>
          After the sync has completed, flip back to the Github in your browser and give it a cheeky refresh. Your local file should now
          appear on their server. If you enter the name of your repository into the URL bar of your browser, it should take you to your
          freshly coded page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Congratulate yourself. Your webpage is now live. You're on your way to a fruitful and fulfilling life of web design!
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        And there you have it, that's how you make a webpage go live with Git. Pretty simple, huh?

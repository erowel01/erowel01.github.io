    <h2>Sunny Leaf Homes Design</h2>

    <p>
      I used a number of techniques in my design to create optimal conversion. Firstly, encapsulation was used. The most important thing
      the user should do is sign up, therefore, the account creation form is surrounded by a purple box. Secondly, contrast. The sign up
      button is bright yellow on a field of purple. Being complementary colours, the yellow pops the most against the purple. Thirdly,
      directional cues. Though subtle, there is a triangular indent on the purple box next to the name. This subtly implies to the user to
      enter their name. The indent would then switch down when the user goes to the next field.
